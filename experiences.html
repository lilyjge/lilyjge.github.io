I joined in grade 9 as a member and became an executive in grade 11. I organized meetings, prepared and taught lessons, inspired interest in math, helped members prepare for contests, and advertised.</p>

                    <p class="text" style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">I co-founded this cultural association with my friend last year, initially to help with the team organizing the Lunar New Year Talent Show at our school. Our regular meetings consist of informative, interactive, and interesting content and activities related to East Asian culture. We had a large stand at our school's Spring Fling, where we sold traditional food and crafts, and offered free hairstyling and face painting in traditional styles. This year, we have fully taken over the planning of the Lunar New Year Talent Show, which we have been working on recently. Everything is going smoothly and we expect to have an excellent show this year, even larger and more professional than previous years. </p>

Before the start of the school year, we attend training sessions where we learn strategies to help grade 9s feel welcome and comfortable. Link leaders are put into pairs and each pair is given ten grade 9s. We lead orientation on the first day of school in September, introducing our grade 9s to the school and providing important advice.</p>

I edit and polish articles regularly before publication.</p>

                    <p class="text" style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">This summer, I attended the month-long Shad program at Dalhousie University. It was an extremely valuable experience, consisting of a large variety of lectures, workshops, engineering challenges, interactive activities, field trips, a design project, and more. I learned a lot and formed strong connections with the other students and staff there.</p>

                    <p class="text" style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">The Lloyd Auckland Invitational Mathematics Workshop is a week-long workshop hosted by the University of Waterloo. There were about 70 students there, all very interesting and talented.
