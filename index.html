It uses a large language model (Groq API) for dynamic conversations, LangGraph's persistence for short term memory, Pinecone's vector database and retrieval augmented generation for long term memory, and stable diffusion for live art generation. Each of the three characters have a good ending and a bad ending depending on affection level, with a common neutral ending. The true ending for each character is unlocked after obtaining her good ending and bad ending.</p>

                                <p>This was the first game I made by myself, without following a full tutorial. I used the Unity game engine with C# and free assets I found online. The player controls a character in a box from a top-down perspective and must avoid arrows randomly shooting from all four directions, dying if hit. There’s a score function counting how long the player survives and keeping track of the highest score achieved. The development process was rather a struggle and there are many areas that can be improved upon, which I will keep in mind for future games.</p>

                                <p>The BRIGHT benchmark is a dataset consisting of reasoning-intensive queries over diverse domains. We explore retrieval results on BRIGHT using a range of retrieval techniques, including sparse, dense, and fusion methods, and establish reproducible baselines. We then apply listwise reranking with large language models (LLMs) to further investigate the impact of reranking on reasoning-intensive queries. These baselines are integrated into popular retrieval and reranking toolkits Anserini, Pyserini, and RankLLM, with two-click reproducibility that makes them easy to build upon and convenient for further development. While attempting to reproduce the results reported in the original BRIGHT paper, we find that the provided BM25 scores differ notably from those that we obtain using Anserini and Pyserini. We discover that this difference is due to BRIGHT's implementation of BM25, which applies BM25 on the query rather than using the standard bag-of-words approach, as in Anserini, to construct query vectors. This difference has become increasingly relevant due to the rise of longer queries, with BRIGHT's lengthy reasoning-intensive queries being a prime example, and further accentuated by the increasing usage of retrieval-augmented generation, where LLM prompts can grow to be much longer than ''traditional'' search engine queries. Our observation signifies that it may be time to reconsider BM25 approaches going forward in order to better accommodate emerging applications. To facilitate this, we integrate query-side BM25 into both Anserini and Pyserini.</p>
