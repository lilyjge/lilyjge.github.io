                            Hello~ <br> 
                            My name is Lily Ge. I'm a grade 12 student at Abbey Park High School, in Oakville, Ontario. 
                            I like programming and I want to develop something that can help the world one day. 
                            Here are some things I've done so far.

                                <p>This was the first game I made by myself, without following a full tutorial. I used the Unity game engine with C# and free assets I found online. The player controls a character in a box from a top-down perspective and must avoid arrows randomly shooting from all four directions, dying if hit. There’s a score function counting how long the player survives and keeping track of the highest score achieved. The development process was rather a struggle and there are many areas that can be improved upon, which I will keep in mind for future games.</p>
